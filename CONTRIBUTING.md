## Contributing to datalad-slurm

We welcome your contributions, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the code:
* In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `develop` and merge requests should be to `develop`
* Please choose a descriptive branch name
* Merges from `develop` to `master` will be done after prior consultation of the core development team
* Merges from `develop` to `master` are only done for code releases. This way we always have a clean `master` that reflects the current release
* Code should be formatted using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) style
